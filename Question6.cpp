How many of these can be a variable name?

01PWskills  // this is incorrect since a variable name cannot start with a number.

 _FLOAT  //is correct because a variable name can start with underscore.

 int  /* is incorrect as a variable name because int is a reserved keyword and cannot 
 be used as a variable name. */

 FLOAT /*is still correct because C++ is a case sensitive language. Here FLOAT and 
 float are treated differently therefore FLOAT is not a reserved  keyword  hence can
 be used as variable name. */

 You will succeed //is incorrect because no variable can have spaces in between.
